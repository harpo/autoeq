# autoeq
AutoEQ profiles for APO/Peace, wavelet etc.

Inside the Target folders are the eq profiles generated by AutoEQ. 
The source IEMs that can be found there are currently the ones from my squig site https://harpo.squig.link/

Use the xxxParametricEQ.txt for Peace imports and xxxGraphicEQ.txt for wavelet imports.

Many IEMs don't take well to treble gain for therefore there is an additional "no treble eq" AutoEQ profile for each target.
Parameter used in this case: --treble-gain-k=0
